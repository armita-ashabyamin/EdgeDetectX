# EdgeDetectX
This project explores and compares various edge detection algorithms using OpenCV and Python. It includes implementations of Sobel, Enhanced Sobel, Canny, Marr-Hildreth (Laplacian), and Hough Circle Transform techniques on multiple input images. The results are visualized using Matplotlib to highlight the effectiveness of each method.
